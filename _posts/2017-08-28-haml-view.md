title: Haml (HTML abstraction markup language) 
---

[Haml](http://haml.info/){:target="_blank"} is an HTML abstraction markup language mainly used with Ruby. It is a popular alternative to the default Rails templating language (ERB).

> Haml is a markup language thatâ€™s designed to avoid writing inline code in a web document and make the HTML cleaner.

Haml is based on one primary principle: markup should be beautiful.

Haml is a template engine designed to provide a layer of abstraction above HTML. It uses a clean, concise syntax which compiles down to HTML and offers several usability benefits.

You can use Haml in your project, by simply installing the Haml gem. 

In order to run Haml code in your application, files need to have .haml extension.

Following is the example of using Haml in Rails:
```haml
// Example of haml code

%section.container
  %h1= post.title
  %h2= post.subtitle
  .content
    = post.content
```

Slim is another lightweight templating engine. It Offers extended functionality with an arguably more expressive syntax and a quicker compilation speed.

Following is the example of using Slim in Rails:
```slim
// Example of slim code

section.container
  h1= post.title
  h2= post.subtitle
  .content
    = post.content
```

The main advantage of using Slim over Haml is that it is much faster than Haml. I never worked with Slim but I think it is a matter of choice, take a look at both syntaxes and decide which is better.

Hope it will save your time. Thanks :smile:!
