title: ERB (Embedded Ruby)
---

ERB is the Ruby language’s built-in template engine.

ERB is a templating system that embeds Ruby into an HTML document, similar to ASP, JSP and PHP. It preserves the syntax of HTML and allows Ruby code to be embedded within a pair of <% and %> delimiters.

ERB Uses expression tags <%= … %> and scriptlet tags <% … %>

It is Useful for embedding Ruby in any kind of source document, most commonly HTML and XML.

<%= and %> wrap Ruby code whose return value will be output in place of the marker.

<% and %> wrap Ruby code whose return value will NOT be output.

```erb
// Example of erb code

<section class="container">
  <h1><%= post.title %></h1>
  <h2><%= post.subtitle %></h2>
  <div class="content">
    <%= post.content %>
  </div>
</section>
```

Above example shows the erb syntax of using Ruby with HTML.

ERB is good mainly if you have a web designer that will work on plain HTML and does not know either haml or slim. This way he can write HTML and you can embed ruby logic with the proper tags.

Thank you, and Happy coding :smile:!
