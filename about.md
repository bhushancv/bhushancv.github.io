Hello! I'm [Bhushan Jadhav](https://about.me/bhushanjadhav){:target="_blank"}, a Ruby on Rails Developer. Iâ€™ve been developing Web and Mobile applications for many years. In my spare time, I like to explore and learn new things. I'm dedicated towards work and passionate to adopt new technologies. I'm interested in writing what the user interacts with and making sure they have a wonderful experience. I like to work with developers on interesting projects and I am always open to new connections. 

## Wanna get in touch or talk to me about a project?

Please take a few minutes to tell me about it. We can then set up a call to discuss how I can be of most value to your project. Feel free to contact me at [@bhushanjadhav](https://about.me/bhushanjadhav){:target="_blank"}.
